Simple Calculator using Tkinter

This project is a simple calculator built using Python's Tkinter library. The calculator supports both basic and advanced operations, including trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponentials.

Features

Basic Operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Modulus (%)
Advanced Operations:
Natural Logarithm (ln)
Base-10 Logarithm (log)
Trigonometric Calculations (sin, cos, tan, deg)
Exponential Calculations (e, ^)
Square Root (Sqrt)
Factorial (x!)
Reciprocal (1/x)
Pi Constant (pi)
Requirements

Before running the application, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. The tkinter package comes pre-installed with Python in most environments, but if not, install it as follows:

For Ubuntu/Linux:

sudo apt-get install python3-tk
For macOS:

brew install python-tk
For Windows:
Tkinter is typically included with standard Python installations. No additional setup should be needed.

Installation and Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-calculator-tkinter.git
Navigate into the project directory:

cd simple-calculator-tkinter
Run the script:

python calculator.py
Usage

The calculator supports both basic and scientific calculations.
You can perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
Scientific functions such as trigonometry (sin, cos, tan), logarithms (log, ln), and exponentiation are also available.
Calculator Layout

The calculator has a well-organized layout with buttons for digits, arithmetic operations, and advanced scientific functions.

Example:
Type 2 + 3 and click on = to get 5.
Type a number and click on sin to calculate the sine of that number.
Click C to clear the display or DEL to delete one character.
Screenshot

(Optional, include a screenshot of the calculator in action.)
